## Overview
This repository contains all the code needed to recreate the analyses, tables, and figures in the paper "Germline and somatic homologous recombination deficiency features in ovarian high-grade serous carcinoma by self-reported race".  Black individuals experience worse survival after a diagnosis of high-grade serous ovarian carcinoma (HGSC) than white individuals and are underrepresented in ovarian cancer research. To date, our understanding of HGSC homologous recombination deficiency (HRD) is based primarily on the evaluation of tumors from white individuals. In the present study, we characterized HRD features in 178 HGSC cases with self-reported Black race and 123 HGSC cases with self-reported white race.
